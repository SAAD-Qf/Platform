I've automatically configured the first registered user as an admin.

### Manual Setup (If Needed)
If you need to manually set admin privileges:

1. **Access Database** (development only)
2. **Run SQL Command**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

### Security Features
- **Role-Based Access**: Only admin users can access admin panel
- **Protected Routes**: Admin panel requires authentication
- **Secure Database**: All admin actions are logged and validated

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See Admin Link?
1. **Check Login Status**: Make sure you're logged in
2. **Verify Admin Status**: Confirm your account has admin privileges
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes navigation updates need a refresh
4. **Try Direct URL**: Go to `/admin` directly

### Admin Panel Not Loading?
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Database**: Ensure database connection is working
3. **Check Network**: Confirm API endpoints are responding
4. **Contact Support**: If issues persist

### Access Denied Error?
1. **Confirm Login**: Make sure you're authenticated
2. **Check Admin Status**: Verify your account has `is_admin = true`
3. **Database Issue**: Check if user table exists and is populated
